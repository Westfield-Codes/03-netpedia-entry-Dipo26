  <h1><strong>What is Trojan malware?</strong></h1>
  <br>
  <p> A <strong><em>Trojan Malware</em></strong> is an evil software designed to look like a real software. If this software were to be installed unto your device, it grants the malware developer remote access to your device, leaving you vulnerable to variety of destruction and undesired activity.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><strong>Banker Trojan</strong>- Banker trojans are designed to steal bank information from the device it's on </p>
  <p><strong>Game-thief Trojan</strong>- These trojans are designed to access information on certain games in an attempt to steal all your player account information </p>
  <p><strong>Backdoor Trojan</strong>- </p>
  <br>
  <h2><strong>Scenario</strong></h2>
  <p>You're considering shopping on a sketchy website and come across a link saying "<strong>75% OFF CLICK NOW</strong>". 
    <br>
  You click the link thinking it's real but you realized that instead of a coupon code your device started downloading a software. By the time you had realized it was fake, you find out the software can't be uninstalled and you get an email from an unknown person telling you to send them money because they have changed all your passwords. If you don't comply your social media reputation would be ruined and can cost you your job.</p>
